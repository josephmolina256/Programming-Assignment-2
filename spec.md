Problem Statement

Implement and compare three cache eviction policies on the same request sequence:

    FIFO (First-In, First-Out)

    LRU (Least Recently Used)

    OPTFF (Belady’s Farthest-in-Future, optimal offline)

You will also complete a short written component, including a proof that OPTFF is optimal.

You are given:

    A cache of capacity ( k )

    A sequence of ( m ) requests ( r_1, r_2,.., r_m )

For each request:

    If the item is already in the cache, this is a hit.

    Otherwise, this is a miss. Insert the item:

        If the cache is not full, simply insert it.

        If the cache is full, evict one item according to the policy.

Eviction Policies

    FIFO: Evict the item that has been in the cache the longest.

    LRU: Evict the item whose most recent access time is the oldest.

    OPTFF: Among items currently in the cache, evict the one whose next request occurs farthest in the future (or never occurs again).

Input Format

Your program must read input from a file with the following format:
```
k m
r1 r2 r3 ... rm
```

Where:

    ( k ) = cache capacity ( ( k >= 1 ) )

    ( m ) = number of requests

    ( r_1, .., r_m ) = sequence of integer IDs

Output Format

Your program must output:
```
FIFO  : <number_of_misses>
LRU   : <number_of_misses>
OPTFF : <number_of_misses>
```


1. Source Code

All source code needed to compile and run your implementation.
2. Example Inputs and Outputs

    At least one example input file (e.g., example.in)

    The corresponding expected output file (e.g., example.out)

    Your README must explain how to reproduce the output.

3. README.md (Required)

Your README must include:

    Student name(s) and UFID(s)

    Instructions to compile/build the code (if applicable)

    Instructions to run the program, including example commands

    Any assumptions (input/output format, dependencies, etc.)

    Your solutions to the written component

4. Organized Repository Structure

Use a clean layout such as:
```
src/
data/
tests/
```

    Use meaningful filenames.

    Do not submit an unstructured dump of files.

5. Reproducibility

A grader must be able to:

```
git clone <repository>
```
and follow the README to compile (if needed) and run your programs without additional steps.
